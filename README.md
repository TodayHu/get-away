# Get Away
Apple watch sample app to select a destination for a quick get away and see a photo of it.

OK this one is really pointless except as a learning exercise. Still it taught me how to get started building Apple Watch apps.

# Improvements to make
<ul>
	<li>Add a "Facts" controller for each destination</li>
	<li>Maybe add more destinations</li>
</ul>
